Most of the client interfacing is done by the Product Owner.\r\n-   Write clean, composable, and maintainable code as you develop world-class products for our clients.\r\n-   Write automated tests to build and maintain the product we build for our clients.\r\n-   Do code reviews with your squad members.\r\n-   Learn new technologies, languages, and techniques so that you are able to adapt to the evolving needs of our clients.\r\n-   Mentor junior members via pair-programming and sharing your knowledge through team rituals (sprint planning and bi-weekly retrospectives).\r\n-   Collaborate with other team members to define the internal processes and initiatives to help the company accomplish its mission.  [Our handbook](https://compass.nimblehq.co/)  has been written by the whole team.\r\n\r\n### Why it would be awesome to work with us\r\n-   **You will be proud**  of any product that has our name on it.\r\n-   We are an  **engineering-focused company**. Both co-founders are software engineers and led the tech teams at the most prominent e-commerce powerhouses in South East Asia.\r\n-   We really pay attention and care about  **processes, high quality, and aesthetics**.\r\n-   **Strong processes**. We not only believe but also really work following agile principles. Developers work on well-sized and well-defined user stories, do estimate using points and work iteratively in short sprints (1-2 weeks).\r\n-   Regular one-on-one reviews to constantly  **improve and grow**. We have a clearly defined process for our developers to level up continuously not only their technical skills but also soft skills.\r\n-   **The vast amount of learning resources**  (Pluralsight, Pragpub, Leanpub, (e-)books, etc.) and yearly education allowance to step up your game.\r\n-   Private medical insurance (Liberty)  **from day one**, company care fund and social welfare coverage.\r\n-   Great equipment consisting of a MacBook Pro, large screens, and any accessory to let you work comfortably.
